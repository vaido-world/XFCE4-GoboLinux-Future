## Desktop and Thunar
Trash icon is missing.
Maybe Installing gvfs would resolve this.

~~Update information in the XFCE-Meta-Stable Recipe with comments on the includes=()~~ Done  
~~Replace mv with tar -C in the installation script for GoboLinux 17 Live CD~~ Done
 Remember to compile and install libinput for better hardware support such as mouse.
